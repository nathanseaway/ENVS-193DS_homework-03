a. To summarize my data I can take the mean of the number of times I apply sunscreen (response variable) compared between the two categorical groups: went to beach and did not go to beach (predictor variable). This allows me to compare the relation between going to the beach in a day and applying sunscreen, as I believe I apply sunscreeen more on days when I go to the beach.
